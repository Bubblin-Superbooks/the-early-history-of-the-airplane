<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We had a &ldquo;Richards&rdquo; hand anemometer with which we measured the velocity of the wind. Measurements made just before starting the first flight showed velocities of 11 to 12 meters per second, or 24 to 27 miles per hour. Measurements made just before the last flight gave between 9 and 10 meters per second. One made just after showed a little over 8 meters. The records of the Government Weather Bureau at Kitty Hawk gave the velocity of the wind between the hours of 10:30 and 12 o&rsquo;clock, the time during which the four flights were made, as averaging 27 miles at the time of the first flight and 24 miles at the time of the last.</p><p>Wilbur, having used his turn in the unsuccessful attempt on the 14th, the right to the first trial now belonged to me.</p></div> </div>
