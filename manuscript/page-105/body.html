That the head resistances of the framing can be brought to a point much below that usually estimated as necessary. That tails, both vertical and horizontal, may with safety be eliminated in gliding and other flying experiments. That a horizontal position of the operator&rsquo;s body may be assumed without excessive danger, and thus the head resistance reduced to about one-fifth that of the upright position. That a pair of superposed, or tandem, surfaces has less lift in proportion to drift than either surface separately, even after making allowance for weight and head resistance of the connections.</p></div> </div>
