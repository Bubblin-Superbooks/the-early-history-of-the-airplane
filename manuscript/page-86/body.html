The results were very satisfactory, yet we were well aware that this method of testing is never wholly convincing until the results are confirmed by actual gliding experience.</p><p>We then turned our attention to making a series of actual measurements of the lift and drift of the machine under various loads. So far as we were aware, this had never previously been done with any full-size machine. The results obtained were most astonishing, for it appeared that the total horizontal pull of the machine, while sustaining a weight of 52&nbsp;lbs., was only 8.5&nbsp;lbs., which was less than had previously been estimated for head resistance of the framing alone.</p></div> </div>
