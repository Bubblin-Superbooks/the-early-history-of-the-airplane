<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the velocity of the wind was over 35 feet per second and the speed of the machine against this wind ten feet per second, the speed of the machine relative to the air was over 45 feet per second, and the length of the flight was equivalent to a flight of 540 feet made in calm air. This flight lasted only 12 seconds, but it was nevertheless the first in the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised itself by its own power into the air in full flight, had sailed forward without reduction of speed, and had finally landed at a point as high as that from which it started.</p><p>At twenty minutes after eleven Wilbur started on the second flight. The course of this flight was much like that of the first, very much up and down.</p></div> </div>
