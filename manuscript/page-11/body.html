<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A toy so delicate lasted only a short time in the hands of small boys, but its memory was abiding.</p><p>Several years later we began building these helicopteres for ourselves, making each one larger than that preceding. But, to our astonishment, we found that the larger the &ldquo;bat&rdquo; the less it flew. We did not know that a machine having only twice the linear dimensions of another would require eight times the power. We finally became discouraged, and returned to kite-flying, a sport to which we had devoted so much attention that we were regarded as experts. But as we became older we had to give up this fascinating sport as unbecoming to boys of our ages.</p></div> </div>
