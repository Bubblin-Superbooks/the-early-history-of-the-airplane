<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After Mr. Chanute&rsquo;s departure, we suspended one of the drive chains over a sprocket, hanging bags of sand on either side of the sprocket of a weight approximately equal to the pull that would be exerted on the chains when driving the propellers. By measuring the extra amount of weight needed on one side to lift the weight on the other, we calculated the loss in transmission. This indicated that the loss of power from this source would be only 5 per cent., as we originally estimated. But while we could see no serious error in this method of determining the loss, we were very uneasy until we had a chance to run the propellers with the motor to see whether we could get the estimated number of turns.</p><p>The first run of the motor on the machine developed a flaw in one of the propeller shafts which had not been discovered in the test at Dayton.</p></div> </div>
