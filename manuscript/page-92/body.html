Accordingly, the curvature of the surfaces was increased to one in 12, to conform to the shape on which Lilienthal&rsquo;s table was based, and to be on the safe side we decided also to increase the area of the machine from 165 square feet to 308 square feet, although so large a machine had never before been deemed controllable. The Lilienthal machine had an area of 151 square feet; that of Pilcher, 165 square feet; and the Chanute double-decker, 134 square feet. As our system of control consisted in a manipulation of the surfaces themselves instead of shifting the operator&rsquo;s body, we hoped that the new machine would be controllable, notwithstanding its great size.</p></div> </div>
