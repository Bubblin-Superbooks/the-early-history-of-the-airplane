And during the larger part of this time, while the machine remained exactly in the rising current, there was no descent at all, but even a slight rise. If the operator had had sufficient skill to keep himself from passing beyond the rising current he would have been sustained indefinitely at a higher point than that from which he started.</p><p>In looking over our experiments of the past two years, with models and full-size machines, the following points stand out with clearness:&mdash;</p></div> </div>
