While the test had shown nothing as to whether the power of the motor was sufficient to keep the machine up, since the landing was made many feet below the starting point, the experiment had demonstrated that the method adopted for launching the machine was a safe and practical one. On the whole, we were much pleased.</p><p>Two days were consumed in making repairs, and the machine was not ready again till late in the afternoon of the 16th.
