For a time we were led to suspect that the lift of curved surfaces little exceeded that of planes of the same size, but further investigation and experiment led to the opinion that (1)&nbsp;the anemometer used by us over-recorded the true velocity of the wind by nearly 15 per cent.; (2)&nbsp;that the well-known Smeaton coefficient of .005&nbsp;V2 for the wind pressure at 90 degrees is probably too great by at least 20 per cent.; (3)&nbsp;that Lilienthal&rsquo;s estimate that the pressure on a curved surface having an angle of incidence of three degrees equals .545 of the pressure at 90 degrees is too large, being nearly 50 per cent. greater than very recent experiments of our own with a special pressure testing machine indicate; (4)&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
