<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When it should reach a proper height the operator would cast off the rope and glide down to the ground just as from the top of a hill. In this way we would be saved the trouble of carrying the machine uphill after each glide, and could make at least 10 glides in the time required for one in the other way. But when we came to try it we found that a wind of 17 miles, as measured by Richards&rsquo; anemometer, instead of sustaining the machine with its operator, a total weight of 240&nbsp;lbs., at an angle of incidence of three degrees, in reality would not sustain the machine alone&mdash;100&nbsp;lbs.&mdash;at this angle. Its lifting capacity seemed scarcely one-third of the calculated amount. In order to make sure that this was not due to the porosity of the cloth, we constructed two small experimental surfaces of equal size, one of which was air-proofed and the other left in its natural state;</p></div> </div>
