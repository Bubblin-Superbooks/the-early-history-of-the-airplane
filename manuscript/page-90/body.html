<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This deficiency we supposed might be due to one or more of the following causes:&mdash;(1)&nbsp;That the depth of the curvature of our surfaces was insufficient, being only about one in 22, instead of one in 12. (2)&nbsp;That the cloth used in our wings was not sufficiently air-tight. (3)&nbsp;That the Lilienthal tables might themselves be somewhat in error. We decided to arrange our machine for the following year so that the depth of the curvature of its surfaces could be varied at will and its covering air-proofed.</p><p>Our attention was next turned to gliding, but no hill suitable for the purpose could be found near our camp at Kitty Hawk. This compelled us to take the machine to a point four miles south, where the Kill Devil sand hill rises from the flat sand to a height of more than 100 feet.</p></div> </div>
