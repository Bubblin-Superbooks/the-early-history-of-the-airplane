<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Making allowance for the weight carried, it appeared that the head resistance of the framing was but little more than 50 per cent. of the amount which Mr. Chanute had estimated as the head resistance of the framing of his machine. On the other hand, it appeared sadly deficient in lifting power as compared with the calculated lift of curved surfaces of its size. This deficiency we supposed might be due to one or more of the following causes:&mdash;(1)&nbsp;That the depth of the curvature of our surfaces was insufficient, being only about one in 22, instead of one in 12. (2)&nbsp;That the cloth used in our wings was not sufficiently air-tight. (3)&nbsp;That the Lilienthal tables might themselves be somewhat in error. We decided to arrange our machine for the following year so that the depth of the curvature of its surfaces could be varied at will and its covering air-proofed.</p></div> </div>
