Later, when they heard that we were making flights of several minutes&rsquo; duration, knowing that longer flights had been made with airships, and not knowing any essential difference between airships and flying machines, they were but little interested.</p><p>We had not been flying long in 1904 before we found that the problem of equilibrium had not as yet been entirely solved. Sometimes, in making a circle, the machine would turn over sidewise despite anything the operator could do, although, under the same conditions in ordinary straight flight, it could have been righted in an instant. In one flight, in 1905, while circling around a honey locust tree at a height of about 50 feet, the machine suddenly began to turn up on one wing, and took a course toward the tree.</p></div> </div>
