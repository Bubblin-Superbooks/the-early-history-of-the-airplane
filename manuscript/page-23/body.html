We saw only one other explanation&mdash;that the tables of air-pressures in general use were incorrect.</p><p>We then turned to gliding&mdash;coasting downhill on the air&mdash;as the only method of getting the desired practice in balancing a machine. After a few minutes&rsquo; practice we were able to make glides of over 300 feet, and in a few days were safely operating in 27-mile winds. In these experiments we met with several unexpected phenomena. We found that, contrary to the teachings of the books, the center of pressure on a curved surface traveled backward when the surface was inclined, at small angles, more and more edgewise to the wind.</p></div> </div>
