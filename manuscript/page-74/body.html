<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>While we were standing about discussing this last flight, a sudden strong gust of wind struck the machine and began to turn it over. Everybody made a rush for it.</p><p>By Wilbur Wright</p><p>THE difficulties which obstruct the pathway to success in flying machine construction are of three general classes: (1)&nbsp;Those which relate to the construction of the sustaining wings. (2)&nbsp;Those which relate to the generation and application of the power required to drive the machine through the air. (3)&nbsp;Those relating to the balancing and steering of the machine after it is actually in flight. Of these difficulties two are already to a certain extent solved. Men already know how to construct wings or aeroplanes which, when driven through air at sufficient speed, will not only sustain the weight of the wings themselves, but also that of the engine, and of the engineer as well.</p></div> </div>
