<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was not till the news of the sad death of Lilienthal reached America in the summer of 1896 that we again gave more than passing attention to the subject of flying. We then studied with great interest Chanute&rsquo;s &ldquo;Progress in Flying Machines,&rdquo; Langley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Experiments in Aerodynamics,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Aeronautical Annuals&rdquo; of 1905, 1906, and 1907, and several pamphlets published by the Smithsonian Institution, especially articles by Lilienthal and extracts from Mouillard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Empire of the Air.&rdquo; The larger works gave us a good understanding of the nature of the flying problem, and the difficulties in past attempts to solve it, while Mouillard and Lilienthal, the great missionaries of the flying cause, infected us with their own unquenchable enthusiasm, and transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers.</p></div> </div>
