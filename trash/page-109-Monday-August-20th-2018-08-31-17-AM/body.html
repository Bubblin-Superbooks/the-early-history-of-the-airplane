That a horizontal position of the operator&rsquo;s body may be assumed without excessive danger, and thus the head resistance reduced to about one-fifth that of the upright position. That a pair of superposed, or tandem, surfaces has less lift in proportion to drift than either surface separately, even after making allowance for weight and head resistance of the connections.</p><p>Transcriber's Note:</p><p>:</p><p>Wilbur, who was at one end, seized it in front, Mr. Daniels and I, who were behind, tried to stop it behind, tried to stop it by holding to the rear uprights.</p></div> </div>
