<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the anemometer used by us over-recorded the true velocity of the wind by nearly 15 per cent.; (2)&nbsp;that the well-known Smeaton coefficient of .005&nbsp;V2 for the wind pressure at 90 degrees is probably too great by at least 20 per cent.; (3)&nbsp;that Lilienthal&rsquo;s estimate that the pressure on a curved surface having an angle of incidence of three degrees equals .545 of the pressure at 90 degrees is too large, being nearly 50 per cent. greater than very recent experiments of our own with a special pressure testing machine indicate; (4)&nbsp;that the superposition of the surfaces somewhat reduced the lift per square foot, as compared with a single surface of equal area.</p><p>In gliding experiments, however, the amount of lift is of less relative importance than the ratio of lift to drift, as this alone decides the angle of gliding descent.</p></div> </div>
